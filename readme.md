# Rationale

I wanted to create a band & user portal bassed web site that would allow users to read ours and others blogs on good bands & night spots to visit for live music , leave comments on other peoples posts , by merchandise ( where avaible ) and even create & have their own account with us . 

# Design 

I wanted the web site to be easy to use and navagiate via the nav bar at the top but also be pleasing to the eye , the first thing you see when you click into the page is an image to catch youe eye with a button that will navigate you to another part of the page "About us". by importing the Agency bootstrap theme I was able to chage both the colour & font of the text within the page to seem more stylish. you will already be able to ready blogs posts but will not be able to add your own until you have an account with us , once you have an account you will also be able to comment on posts using the imported Disqus system. on the merch page there are a listing of several items witch can be viewed and purchesed via a Stripe payment system , the price/ rateing & quantity of each item is visiable within each items given box .
Although the Register page is fairly simply , for this site we do not require much imformation , just email address , username , password & password conformation. once your account is created you will have full access and functionality of the site just log in and enjoy.
